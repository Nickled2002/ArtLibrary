# ArtLibrary
This project is an art library created to store information about art pieces in a local database while also allowing the user to view images of the art search for a specific painting based on multiple criteria, manage the databse using CRUD operations and determine the dominant colour of a painting or art piece.
It was developed in Java and was reuploaded to github years after its development
